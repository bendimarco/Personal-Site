          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>Hello! I am Tomas Germanas, a Junior at Centennial High School. The piano has always been a major part of my life, and I started playing when I was 5 years old. Since then, I sought to apply my music skills and interests in as many ways as I could. My first time branching out was learning the clarinet, and I am the 2nd chair clarinet player of the Centennial High School Wind Ensemble. I also volunteer in various music-related activities. I am a member of the Tri-M Music Honor Society and a member of the board of the Music Mentors Club, where I provide free, supplemental lessons to students at Burleigh Manor Middle School. Now, my most recent project is “I’ve Got Your Bach”, and I am committed to providing quality accompaniment to students at a low price.</p>
